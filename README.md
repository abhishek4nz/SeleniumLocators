# SeleniumLocators
This is my second repository. I am creating it to store selenium practice scripts.

I am using the JUnit framework to write selenium scripts and I have integrated it with Maven for dependencies and build generation.
I have used my local git and remote GitHub as repositories.

I am practising basic selenium scripts now. I have plans to move to advanced level using the TestNG framework for framework development.
In the future I plan to learn BDD using Cucumber and JUnit.
